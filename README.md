# UserInterface-Design


Introduction
The tourism website for hobbyists I have created focuses on the discovery of high-end Nigerian cuisine that can be found within the city of London. When a tourist visits London, they are introduced to an unfamiliar environment. My website fosters the connection between tourists interested in Nigerian cuisine and the businesses within London that provide this at a high quality, as a result the tourist can feel comfortable in knowing where to look when they go out to eat and try out different cuisines, in this case Nigerian cuisine. The key user requirements would be for the user to be able to seamlessly navigate and explore through a variety of Nigerian restaurant businesses. Another one would be that the user must be able to select restaurants based on certain requirements such as location and rating.

Prototype Functionality
A development list of the functions/features:

Unique

A map navigator feature. The map is imbedded with icons each representing a restaurant that serves Nigerian cuisine. When the user hovers above the icon, the small information box appears giving the user insight into the restaurant name and rating. The user can click on the icon to navigate to the section of the page with more specific information about that restaurant that the icon represents.

This would meet the user requirements as the user can select the restaurant icon of their choice based on factors such as location and rating as they can view where each restaurant is located and can see the ratings when they hover over the map markers.

Common

A mailing form that gives users the option to submit their email, to join a mailing list. The user can now stay updated with new features and restaurants added.

Link to restaurant websites so users can place orders/bookings, find out more specific information etc.

Images of restaurants to give users visual representation.

A responsive navigation bar so users can seamlessly use the webpage.

Background Technologies
Bootstrap:

I used bootstrap to get the designs for my icons. These icons add visual appeal to my webpage and allow for users to comprehend and identify information very quickly.
Google Maps JavaScript API:

This will allow me to imbed google maps functions into my website.
Json:

This means I can quickly create and fill in data for each restaurant and iterate through the data to create the restaurant location markers and front-end display of each restaurant data.
Although this is a prototype, using Json is less time consuming than hardcoding all the data I want to display.
